# CPP-Kids-Matching-Game

A simple C++ game for kids to play.

There will also (maybe) be a challenge mode where the user can play against the computer.

## Main Menu
The game will consist of a simplistic main menu where the user can select either 'Play' or 'Exit'.

Clicking 'Play' will bring up a new screen so that the user can select the difficulty (the number of cards that will be involved.)

Once the user has selected their desired difficulty level, the application will begin to render the cards and the game will then start.
